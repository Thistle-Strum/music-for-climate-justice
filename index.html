                    <h3>About Us:</h3>
                    <p>Music for Climate Justice is a collective of musicians and creatives who share a love for the earth and a concern for the future of our planet. Our aim is to build community around Climate Justice through music. We do a number of community arts events, from hosting benefit shows, to organizing song circles to hosting workshop series. We are always looking for new ways to engage creatively in the conversation around climate justice, and always striving to reduce barriers for people to participate creatively and join the conversation.
